   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

=========
nashvegas
=========

The purpose of this app is to enable a plug and play method for managing
database changes.

Database migrations is a large topic with a lot of different approaches.  This
approach worked well for my needs and maybe it will for you as well.


Installation
------------

* pip install nashvegas
* Add the application to your INSTALLED_APPS list in your settings.py file.


Usage
-----

nashvegas ships with two management commands, ``upgradedb`` and ``comparedb``.
The first, ``upgradedb``, will manage the creation, listing, and execution of
individual migrations. The second, ``comparedb``, is currently an experimental
command that attempts to help you discover missing migrations.

* Execute the command line:

    $ ./manage.py upgradedb --create|--list|--execute
    $ ./manage.py comparedb


Options for upgradedb
---------------------

* ``--create`` - Compares database with current models in apps that are
  installed and outputs the sql for them so that you can easily pipe the
  contents to a migration.
* ``--list`` - Lists all the scripts that will need to be executed.
* ``--execute`` - Executes all the scripts that need to be executed.
* ``--seed`` - Populates Migration model with scripts that have already been
  applied to your database and effectively want to skip execution. Provide a
  migration id to stop at. For instance, running
  `./manage.py upgradedb --seed 005` will skip migrations 000 to 005 but not
  006.


Conventions
-----------

Part of the simplicity of this solution is based on the naming conventions of
the sql scripts.  They should be named in a manner that enforces order.  Some
examples include::

    0001_short_comment_about_migration.sql
    0001.sql

The model, ``nashvegas.Migration`` will get synced into your database if it
doesn't exist when you go to execute any of the ``upgradedb`` commands.  In this
model the scripts that have been executed will be recorded, effectively
versioning your database.

In addition to sql scripts, ``--execute`` will also execute python scripts that
are in the directory.  This are run in filename order interleaved with the sql
scripts.  For example::

    0001.sql
    0002.py
    0003.sql

The Python script will be executed 2nd between ``0000.sql`` and ``0003.sql``. The script will only be executed if the module contains a callable named ``migrate``. It is a good idea to put all your executing code within a class or series of functions or within a singe ``migrate()`` function so as to avoid code executing upon import.

For example, your script might light like this if you need to update all your
product codes on next release::

    from store.models import Product
    
    def migrate():
        for product in Product.objects.all():
            product.code = "NEW-%s" % product.code
            product.save()
